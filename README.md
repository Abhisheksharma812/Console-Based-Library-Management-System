ðŸ“š Console-Based Library Management System
This is a simple, yet functional, console-based application built in Java to simulate the core operations of a library. The project serves as a practical demonstration of my understanding and application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

âœ¨ Features
This system allows a user to perform the following actions:

Book Management: Add new books to the library, search for existing ones by title or author, and remove books from the collection.

Member Management: Register new members with unique IDs and view member details.

Borrowing & Returning: Check out books to registered members and mark them as returned.

Record Keeping: The system tracks which books are currently on loan and to which member.

ðŸ’» Technologies & Concepts Used
This project is built using Java and highlights the following fundamental programming concepts:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The project is structured around key OOP principles, including:

Classes and Objects: Representing real-world entities like Book, Member, and the Library itself.

Encapsulation: Using private variables and public methods to control access to data within each class.

Abstraction: (Explain how you use it, e.g., using interfaces or abstract classes if you do).

Control Flow: Uses if-else statements, switch statements, and loops to manage the program's logic and user interaction.

Data Structures: (If you used any, e.g., an ArrayList to store the books or a HashMap to store members).

ðŸš€ How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone [your-repository-url]
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd Library-Management-System
Compile the Java files:

Bash

javac src/*.java
Run the main class:

Bash

java src.MainClass
(Note: Replace src.MainClass with the actual path and name of your main class.)
