# Console-Based-Library-Management-System
This is a foundational, console-based application built in Java to simulate a library's core operations. The project's primary goal is to demonstrate a practical implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in a real-world scenario. It is a work-in-progress that I will continue to improve as I learn more.
